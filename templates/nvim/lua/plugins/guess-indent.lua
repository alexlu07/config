-- [[ Installing and Configuring Plugins ]]
--
-- To install a plugin simply call `vim.pack.add` with its git url.
-- This will download the default branch of the plugin, which will usually be `main` or `master`
-- You can also have more advanced specs, which we will talk about later.
--
-- For most plugins its not enough to install them, you also need to call their `.setup()` to start them.
--
-- For example, lets say we want to install `guess-indent.nvim` - a plugin for
-- automatically detecting and setting the indentation.
--
-- We first install it from https://github.com/NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim
-- and then call its `setup()` function to start it with default settings.

---Because most plugins are hosted on GitHub, you can use this helper
---function (repeated at the top of each plugin file) for less repetition.
---@param repo string
---@return string
local function gh(repo) return 'https://github.com/' .. repo end

vim.pack.add { gh 'NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim' }
require('guess-indent').setup {}
